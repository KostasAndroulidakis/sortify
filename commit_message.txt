refactor: Split audio_fingerprint.cpp into modular components

Divided audio_fingerprint.cpp into three specialized files following Single Responsibility Principle:
- spectrogram.cpp: Handles FFT and spectrogram generation
- peak_extraction.cpp: Manages frequency peak detection
- fingerprint.cpp: Creates searchable audio fingerprints

Updated CMakeLists.txt to include the new files.
Removed original monolithic implementation.
